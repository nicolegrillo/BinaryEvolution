The following file contains info regarding the .py files present in the repository. 

# environments_handy_functions.py: 

It contains the classes for each environment type, using M_tot as the total mass = m1 + m2 in the formalism. It also contains the functions to perform the calculations for the dephasing and the time to coalescence, as well as other stuff (like the frqeuency grid and the 1yr-to-merge related frequency). The integrals methods are different from the ODE adopted in the "Phase_Extraction-MAIN.ipynb", otherwise the convergence of the NS takes more than a week to compile!  

# combo_vs_env.py type of file: 

Present in the bias folder, they treat the combo as one single environment. Useful for the Bayes factor calculation. 

# env.ipynb: 

Single environment tests and sampling of posterior with/without noise. 

# Essentials.ipynb: 

A simple summary notebook with the useful plots to produce for the thesis work.
