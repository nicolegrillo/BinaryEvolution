# BinaryEvolution

This repository contains the materials for my thesis project, which focuses on studying the effect of environments with respect to vacuum gravitational wave solutions. An example of the dephasing from the vacuum case is shown below.

## Folders:

### stats_analysis:

**Description:** It contains the injected-signal tests I did on the different parameters of the binary to recover their posterior distribution, according to Bayesian statistics and Nested Sampling algorithms. They are distinguished between biased signal analysis and single systems analysis, depending on the injections/analysis pairs.  

### Old works:

**Description:** Old notebooks used during the setting phase, along with qualitative study. 

## Usage:

To use these Jupyter Notebook files, open them in a compatible environment such as Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and execute the cells sequentially. Ensure that the required dependencies and datasets are available in your environment. For the .py files, do the same, ensuring you have downloaded the environments_handy_functions.py library, as well as the pydd library, following the instructions available at [https://github.com/pipcole/pydd/tree/main].
