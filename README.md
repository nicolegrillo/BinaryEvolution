This repository contains the materials for my thesis project, which focuses on studying the effect of environments on dephasing with respect to vacuum gravitational wave solutions.

## Files:

### Phase_extraction-MAIN.ipynb

**Description:** This Jupyter Notebook file contains the final class I developed for generating and analyzing systems to observe dephasing. It implements numerical and analytical integrations for validation and prediction of the detectability of one environment compared to another.

### Phase_extraction-Static-dm.ipynb

**Description:** This Jupyter Notebook file delves into understanding the impact of dark matter density profiles on dephasing. It explores various possibilities, including static or dynamic profiles, and conducts analyses using the code pydd from [pydd](https://github.com/pipcole/pydd/tree/main/src/pydd) for comparison.

### Phase_extraction.ipynb

**Description:** This initial Jupyter Notebook contains the first attempts to write the functions used in Phase_extraction-MAIN.ipynb. It includes tests of numerical integration methods and comparisons with alternative approaches for phase determination.

### Phase_extraction_Class+params.ipynb

**Description:** This Jupyter Notebook focuses on defining a class to encapsulate functions necessary for analysis while conducting simulations of dephasing under different parameter sets.

### Phase_extraction_Parameter-Comparison.ipynb

**Description:** This Jupyter Notebook compares the effects of parameter changes on dephasing. It generates meshgrid plots to visualize changes in dephasing frequencies when varying two parameters simultaneously. Additionally, it addresses the question of the maximum detectable frequency for each parameter realization.

## Usage:

To utilize these Jupyter Notebook files, open them in a compatible environment such as Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and execute the cells sequentially. Ensure that the required dependencies and datasets are available in your environment.
